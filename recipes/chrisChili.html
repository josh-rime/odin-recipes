    <h1>Chris's Chili Recipe</h1>
    <p>This Coca-Cola chili is my recipe, and it has won over 12 chili cook-offs, so I figured I'd share. It is a medium steak and bean chili similar to Steak N' Shake's chili — but better. It is somewhat involved, but trust me, it is worth every minute. Try it; you will not be disappointed.

          <ol>
            <li>Place bacon grease into a large stainless steel soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir cubed round and sirloin steak meat in hot bacon grease until well browned, about 10 minutes. Pour in onion soup and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 7 minutes, stirring to dissolve any browned flavor bits from the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Stir in kidney beans, tomato sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently to avoid burning the bottom. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Stir in cola, pepper sauce, and cocoa. Simmer until flavors blend, about 20 more minutes. Serve hot.</li>
          </ol>
